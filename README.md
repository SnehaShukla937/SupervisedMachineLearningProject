# Supervised Machine Learning:
Supervised Machine Learning is all about training lots of preprocessed input data (past data) with labels, evaluate performance of trained model and after getting satisfactory performance using that model to perform prediction on new data. If labels or output is continuous value then it is *Regression* and if these are categorical or discrete value then it is *classification*.
# Some Basic Supervised ML Algorithms:
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
5. K Nearest Neighbour
6. Naive Bayes
7. Support Vector Machine
# Description:
Here i have used *ScikitLearn* machine learning library to build some simple and basic models using different algorithms. Steps involved to build ML models:
1. Import Data
2. Data Analysis
3. Data Cleaning
4. Model training & testing
5. Performance evaluation
# ScikitLearn installation using pip:
pip install sklearn
